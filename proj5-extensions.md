# Quantum effects: Possible project extensions

The example project here illustrates how you can calculate the dynamical properties and nuclear quantum effects for a 
system of Lennard Jones particles.  The extension to this project is to try to run simulations like those in the example
report for a system of particles that interact through a different pair potential.  A sensible choice would be to re-use
the potential that you developed when extending [project 4](proj4-extensions.md).
