# Single particle MD: Possible project extensions

In the example project, the particle sits on on the following potential:

$$
V(x) = x^2
$$ 

and we study the heat capacity as a function of temperature. The obvious extension
is to examine how the heat capacity behaves for other potentials. These could be 
higher powers of $x$, trigonometric functions or any other potential you can imagine. 
In real systems the heat capacity depends on temperature. Peaks in this 
response function when systems cross phase boundaries is why there is a latent
heat for melting or evaporation. Can you find a simple 1D potential for which the 
heat capacity does depend on temperature?
