# Ising model: Possible project extensions

In the example project each of the spins interacts with the magnetic field and its four nearest neighbours.  In other words,
spin $s_{i,j}$ interacts with spins $s_{i-1,j}$, $s_{i+1,j}$, $s_{i,j-1}$ and $s_{i,j+1}$ and the external magnetic field.
To extend this idea you can study a system of spins where the pattern of interactions is different.  For example, you might have 
spin $s_{i,j}$ only interact with spins $s_{i-1,j}$ and $s_{i+1,j}$ or you could extend the range of interactions to the second nearest
neighbours so spin $s_{i,j}$ starts interacting with spins like $s_{i,j-2}$, $s_{i,j+2}$ and so on. 

If you want to be even more ambitious you could investigate systems of spins that sit on a non-square lattice.  
If the spin $s_{i,j}$ interacts more weakly with spins $s_{i-1,j}$ and $s_{i+1,j}$ than with spins
$s_{i,j-1}$ and $s_{i,j+1}$ then the spins are sat on a rectangular lattice in which the $j$ direction is shorter than the $i$ direction.  
However, there are even more exotic lattice options than this.  You can, for instance, have the spins
sit on a triangular lattice or a hexagonal lattice.

If you write a report that describes simulations that you have done to investigate the beahviour of the magnetisation for a system of Ising
spins please include a figure that illustrates how the spins interact as I have done in my example report.
