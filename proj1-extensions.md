# Lattice Gas: Possible project extensions

In the example project each of the particles in my system could be in one of two possible microstates.
The obvious extension for you to try is to see what happens when each of the non-interacting particles can
occupy $m \ge 3$ states.  Notice that when there are more than two states for each particle you can have equally 
spaced levels or non equally spaced levels.  If three energy levels are $E_1 < E_2 < E_3$ you can have 
$E_2-E_1 > E_3-E_2$ or $E_2-E_1 > E_3-E_2$. You can even introduce energy levels that are degenerate and 
examine the effect that this has on the ensemble of particles.

If you want to be particularly ambitious you might even ask if there is a configuration of energy levels where you 
see a platteau in the average energy over a range of temperatures followed by an increase in the average energy.
In short, even though it is possible to evaluate the partition function analytically for any system of non-interacting
particles, there are still ways of treating this system as an [epistemic thing](research.md), applying the 
[technical objects](research.md) you have learned about in completing the exercises in the notebook and finding out new things.
